## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my Github. For those who don't know me, my name is Gabriel Caiana, I'm a Frontend developer passionate about technology and design.

I love developing random apps to experiment with new technologies and project architectures, so feel free to check out my Github or my portfolio as I'm always venturing into a new project.

In recent years I've worked with several technologies, some things I really like and are part of my daily life as a developer are (Javascript, Typescript, Vue, Nuxt, Vuex, Pinia, Jest, GraphQL, Storybook, Vite, Vuetify, Tailwind , node).
