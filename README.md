As a software engineer with five years of experience, I specialize in the JavaScript stack, with a focus on the Vue.js ecosystem, particularly the Nuxt.js framework. My career has been marked by the development of highly scalable and in-demand applications, with a focus on diverse sectors such as e-commerce, transportation, and food services.

My technical approach is grounded in a deep understanding of scalability, robust infrastructure, system design, and architecture. When developing software, my primary goal is to ensure transaction integrity and provide a risk-free user experience through the implementation of intelligent solutions.

In addition to technical skills, I bring valuable experience in team leadership, playing crucial roles in refining technical tasks, conducting estimates, and supporting the development of junior talents. At this juncture, my professional trajectory is focused on enhancing technical leadership, aiming to contribute even more significantly to the success of the projects and teams I am involved with.
