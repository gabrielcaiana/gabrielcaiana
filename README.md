I’m a software engineer focused on modern front-end development, specialized in building scalable, high-performance, and robust web applications. I have extensive experience in the Vue.js and Nuxt.js ecosystems, acting as a technical reference in the creation of rich interfaces and evolutionary architectures.

My role goes beyond feature implementation: I actively contribute to architectural decisions, scalable componentization, reusable design systems, micro frontends, and monorepos—always applying engineering best practices and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams.

In recent years, I’ve expanded my technical scope with a strong focus on modern infrastructure, back-end development with Node.js, and cloud services—especially on AWS—using tools such as Lambda, EC2, S3, DynamoDB, Cognito, API Gateway, IAM, CloudWatch, and CloudFormation.

Core skills:

- Vue 3 & Nuxt 3: advanced knowledge of Composition API, SSR, SSG, reactivity, and best practices;
- Scalable front-end architecture: micro frontends, monorepos, design systems, and domain separation;
- Modern full-stack integration: REST, GraphQL, Firebase, Supabase, PostgreSQL, MongoDB;
Node.js back-end development: building REST/GraphQL APIs, authentication, middlewares, and SQL/NoSQL integrations;
- Performance & quality: lazy loading, code splitting, SSR, and automated testing with Jest, Cypress, and Playwright;
- Front-end DevOps: CI/CD, monitoring, and continuous deployment using Vercel, AWS, and Google Cloud;
- Accessibility (a11y) and usability as pillars of user interface development.
